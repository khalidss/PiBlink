BUGS - Will Cause Problems
=============================================================
1.) Sessions over a certain filesize (somewhere around ~200kb) cause the .json file they are saved in to become jank,
	sometimes freezing up editors that open them.
2.) Session does not save upon completion and exit. The user must click the stop button in order
	it to save.


HAZARDS - Could Cause Problems
=============================================================
1.) Session Name can contain invalid filename characters (ie "Cool, Dude?")
2.) ITI variance can be made greater than ITI, possibly resulting in negative ITI values
3.) Large negative numbers are sometimes recorded (ex: -1428.2390...), which may cause issues if the data is used in any data analysis (averages, medians, etc.)
4.) ITIs may not be accurately timed (When "next trial" timer reaches 0.0, there is a slight delay before the next trial actually starts)
5.) Play button can be pressed after trials have completed, resulting in a new set of trials starting that will have its data appended to the previous sessions data.


QUALITY - Not Major, but Inconvenient/Potentially Frustrating
=============================================================
1.) Number of Trials increments/decrements by 5 with mousewheel. This makes it inconvenient to fine tune
	the number of trials, and furthermore is prone to the following: [60 -> 55 -> 50 -> 45 -> ... -> 5 -> 1 -> 6 -> 11 -> 16 -> ...]
	So the number of trials can get stuck on 1s and 6s instead of 0s and 5s, requiring manual entering
	of the number via keyboard to reset.
2.) Confirmation to stop current session is made even when in playback mode.
3.) Stopping playback brings the user back to Data Acquisition mode.
